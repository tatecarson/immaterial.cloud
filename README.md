# immaterial.cloud 

[immaterial.cloud](immaterial.cloud) is an immersive audiovisual installation that explores a possible networked future of peer-to-peer technologies, away from the cloud. Participants experience the work via two to four smartphones placed in different locations in a room. As participants walk up to a phone, they see a representation of themselves through data. If the participant gets close enough, the phone triggers a change in the sound of [immaterial.cloud](immaterial.cloud) and the other phones follow.
